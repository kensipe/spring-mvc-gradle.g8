    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>

    <p>The Gogo Video Service is provided by Gogo LLC. Please read these Conditions of Use for the Gogo Video
        Service, and the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for the Gogo Inflight Internet Service (collectively, the
        "Agreement"), before using the Gogo Video Service (the "Service"). If you use the Service, you will be bound by
        the Agreement. (Click here to read the Terms of Use and click here to read the Privacy Policy.)</p>

    <h2>The Service</h2>

    <p>The Service offers digitized versions of movies, television shows and other video content (collectively, "Digital
        Content"). The Service allows you to access and view Digital Content by downloading a copy to an authorized
        device (defined below).</p>

    <h2>Authorized Devices</h2>

    <p>In order to download Digital Content from the Service you will need to use a Wi-Fi enabled personal computer that
        (1) meets minimum service requirements that Gogo may establish from time to time and (2) supports the digital
        rights management system for the Digital Content you access on the Service (each such device an "Authorized
        Device.") Each Authorized Device can be linked to only one account for the downloading of Digital Content from
        the Service.</p>

    <h2>License to Digital Content Downloads</h2>

    <p>The Service allows you to pay a fee to download Digital Content and view it an unlimited amount of times for a
        limited period of time ("Rented Digital Content").</p>

    <p>Rented Digital Content. Upon your payment of the rental fee, Gogo grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable
        limited right and license to download and view the Rented Digital Content on an Authorized Device. Unless
        otherwise provided, the license for the Rented Digital Content is limited in its term and duration to 24 hours
        from your payment of the rental fee.</p>

    <p>Non-Commercial Private Use. Both Purchased Digital Content and Rented Digital Content are limited to
        Non-Commercial Private Use, which means a presentation of Digital Content (i) for which no fee or consideration
        of any kind is charged or received (other than that which you pay to us to purchase or rent the Digital
        Content), (ii) which takes place on an airplane or in your private home (or other private space such as a hotel
        room or office) and (iii) is limited to a private viewing for you and your invitees. Non-Commercial Private Use
        specifically excludes any public presentation and any presentation by a place of public accommodation (such as a
        restaurant or bar), even if no fee is charged for viewing the Digital Content.</p>

    <p>Once you rent Digital Content and we make the Digital Content available to you to download, you bear
        responsibility for completing the download and for all risk of loss of the Digital Content after download is
        complete. If you are unable to complete a download of Digital Content prior to the landing of the airplane on
        which you are flying, you will still be able to complete the download after landing by re-connecting to the
        Internet through a land-based Internet service provider (i.e., not Gogo Inflight Internet).</p>

    <p>All purchases and rentals of Digital Content are final when you click the “Buy Now” button. If you rent Digital
        Content and are unable to view it, please contact Customer Care at 877.350.0038. We will work with you to try to
        solve the problem and if we are unable to do so we will refund your purchase or rental fee.</p>

    <h2>General Terms</h2>

    <p>You may not transfer, copy or display the Digital Content, except as permitted above. In addition, you may not
        (i) sell, rent, lease, distribute, broadcast, sublicense or otherwise assign any right to the Digital Content to
        any third party; (ii) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Digital Content; (iii) attempt to disable,
        bypass, modify, defeat or otherwise circumvent any digital rights management system used as part of the Service;
        or (iv) use the Service or Digital Content for any commercial or illegal purpose.</p>

    <p>Except for the rights explicitly granted to you in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in the Service
        and the Digital Content are reserved and retained by Gogo and our licensors, and Gogo and our licensors do not
        transfer any right, title or interest in the Digital Content to you.</p>

    <p>THE SERVICE AND THE DIGITAL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
        NON-INFRINGEMENT. Any Digital Content you download through the Service is done at your own risk and you will be
        solely responsible for any damage, including damage to your Authorized Devices or loss of data, that results
        from your use of the Service or download of any Digital Content.</p>

    <p>NEITHER GOGO NOR ITS LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR USE
        OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, OR OTHER DIRECT,
        INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS.</p>

    <p>If you violate any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, your license to Digital Content will immediately
        terminate and we may in our discretion immediately revoke your access to the Service without notice to you and
        without refund of any fees. In such event you must delete all copies of Digital Content that you have downloaded
        and we shall have the right to automatically discontinue your access to Digital Content from the Service.</p>

    <p>You understand that by using the Service, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent or
        objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as such. You agree to use the Service at your sole
        risk and Gogo shall have no liability to you for content that you may deem offensive, indecent or
        objectionable.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue the Service or any part thereof at any time and without
        notice to you, and we will not be liable to you should we exercise such rights, even if your use of Digital
        Content is impacted by the change.</p>

    <p>Gogo reserves the right to make changes to this Agreement at any time. Your continued use of the Service
        following any such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <p>Providers of Digital Content that you rent or purchase on the Service are intended third-party beneficiaries
        under this Agreement.</p>
